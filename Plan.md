# Plan for News Aggregator
## Docker

- Develop everything in docker to prevent messing up my computer environment

## Langchain

- Manually wire up everything first

- Migrate all the things to LlamaIndex

- Keep the embedding model I am using

## LlamaIndex

- Setup all the things migrate from LangChain

- Use KaLM-Embedding-Gemma3-12B-2511 or other model I am using, cooperate with LangChain if not available on LlamaIndex natively

## LLM

- Must be free to use

- Integrate with LLM

- Haven't decided which one to use (ollama, langchain, API)

## Backend

- Build backend with essential functionalities

## Frontend

- React

- Typescript
